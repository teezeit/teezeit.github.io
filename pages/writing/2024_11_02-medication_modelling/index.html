                    Understanding the pharmacokinetics of medications is crucial for optimizing therapeutic effects and
                    minimizing side effects. In this post, we delve into the modeling of Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine
                    dimesylate), a medication commonly prescribed for ADHD. Using data extracted from a research paper,
                    we created a generalized bi-exponential model to represent the absorption and elimination phases of
                    the medication in the bloodstream. This model has been integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit
                    application, allowing individuals to input their medication schedule and dosage to visualize and
                    compare the concentration of Elvanse over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By fitting a bi-exponential model to the blood concentration data extracted from a plot in the
                    paper, we can accurately represent how the medication is absorbed and eliminated from the body. This
                    approach helps to provide personalized insights into how different dosages and timing schedules
                    affect the medication's concentration throughout the day.

                    Whether you have a critical task at 4 PM or need to plan your dosage to maintain optimal
                    concentration levels, this tool allows you to input your medication times and dosages, then compare
                    the resulting concentration profiles. This can aid in making more informed decisions about your
                    medication regimen, ensuring you achieve the desired therapeutic effect when you need it most.

                    Let's explore how this model was developed and how you can use the app to tailor your medication
                    schedule to fit your personal needs.
